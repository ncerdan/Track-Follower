GOAL:

    Write a program to control a car to follow a black curvey path on the ground.


CAR DESIGN:

    - 2 motor controlled wheels
    - 3 IR-LEDs / Phototransistor pairs to detect the black line beneath the car
    - 3 LEDs (r,g,b) to communicate car's action intentions


EXPLANATION OF IMPLEMENTATAION:

    The code sets up a simple guard rail approach. As the black line goes beneath the sensor
    on the left, the car adjusts itself to turn to the left more to re-center itself. If the
    right sensor finds the black line, it turns itself to the right to fix its course. If neither
    of the sensors find the line, the car continues forwards at a faster rate.

    The end of the track was marked with a perpendicular line of black, so if all three sensors discover
    a black line, the car comes to a halt indefinitely.

    The IR-LEDs / Phototransistors act as 'line sensors' because when the black line is beneath a sensor,
    it reflects more of its IR light back into the phototransistor. The circuit is designed so as the
    phototransistor absorbs more light, its resistance is increased, causing more voltage to be read by
    the input pins I used in my Arduino. By monitoring the input voltages of each pair, I could track
    where the black line was relative to the car and keep it on course.

    As the car performed vairous tasks (turning left, going straight, stopping, etc.) it communicated to the
    viewer what it was doing via 3 LEDs (r,g,b) located on the top of the vehicle.
